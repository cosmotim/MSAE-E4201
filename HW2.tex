1.[10 points] A vessel containing 10 kg of water having a 
temperature of 50 °C and another vessel containing 5 kg of what of 25 °C 
are put into thermal contact and then thermally isolated from the surroundings. 
What will be the temperature of the water in the vessels when  thermal  equilibrium  has  been  reached?  
(NB  The  heat  involved  in  changing  the  temperature of the vessels when empty may be neglected.)
